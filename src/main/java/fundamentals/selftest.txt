1. Bytecode is code that is processed by a virtual machine (JVM in the case of Java). It is key to Java's use for Internet programming because it removes the need for seperate compilers for every CPU and the JVM also contains the code within the virtual machine, so it cannot do any harm to the computer.

2. Encapsulation, Polymorphism & Inheritance.

3. At the main method

4. A variable is a space reserved in memory that can be assigned values. (Values can also be changed throughout the execution of the program.)

        weight = 80; //example weight of 80 kg

        moonWeight=weight*0.17;
        System.out.println("weight+ "kg on the moon is "+moonWeight+"kg.");

}
}
